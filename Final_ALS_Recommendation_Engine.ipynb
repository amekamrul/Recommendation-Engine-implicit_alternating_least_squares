Fortunately, as I was still finishing this up, Ben Frederickson at Flipboard had perfect timing and came out with a version of ALS for Python utilizing Cython and parallelizing the code among threads. You can read his blog post about using it for finding similar music artists using matrix factorization here and his implicit library here. He claims it is even faster than Quora's C++ QMF, but I haven't tried theirs. All I can tell you is that it is over 1000 times faster than this bare bones pure Python version when I tested it. Install this library before you continue and follow the instructions. If you have conda installed, just do pip install implicit and you should be good to go.\n",

    "Remember that our training set had 20% of the purchases masked? This will allow us to evaluate the performance of our recommender system. Essentially, we need to see if the order of recommendations given for each user matches the items they ended up purchasing. A commonly used metric for this kind of problem is the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (or ROC) curve. A greater area under the curve means we are recommending items that end up being purchased near the top of the list of recommended items. Usually this metric is used in more typical binary classification problems to identify how well a model can predict a positive example vs. a negative one. It will also work well for our purposes of ranking recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, we need to write a function that can calculate a mean area under the curve (AUC) for any user that had at least one masked item. As a benchmark, we will also calculate what the mean AUC would have been if we had simply recommended the most popular items. Popularity tends to be hard to beat in most recommender system problems, so it makes a good comparison.\n",
